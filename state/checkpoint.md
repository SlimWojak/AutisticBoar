thesis: "Conviction scoring system operational. Heartbeat runner integrates Oracle + Narrative + Warden + Scoring. Dry-run cycle 3/10 complete. No live signals detected this cycle."
regime: green
open_positions: 0
next_action: "Continue dry-run cycles. Log scoring on next signal detection. Alert G at cycle 10 with sample scores."
concern: "none — pipeline validated with demo signal (DITTMANN vetoed by Rug Warden as expected)"
