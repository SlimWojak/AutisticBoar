# Idea Bank

Future enhancements and extensions for AutistBoar. Items are PARKED until core trading loop is validated.

## Ideas

| # | Date       | Idea | Source | Status |
|---|------------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 2026-02-10 | Telegram inline buttons for >$100 trade approvals — one-tap approve/reject instead of typed responses | G | PARKED — after INV-HUMAN-GATE-100 tested in production |
| 2 | 2026-02-10 | Multi-token position heat map in daily digest — visual representation of portfolio exposure by sector/narrative | G | PARKED |
| 3 | 2026-02-10 | Weekly autopsy digest — most valuable beads from the week, pattern synthesis, what worked/what didn't | G | PARKED |
| 4 | 2026-02-11 | `state/feedback/` directory — structured G approvals/rejections that persist into future heartbeat decisions. Closes the loop between Edge Bank (what happened) and behavioral change (what G thought about it). Pattern validated by shared-context architecture in OpenClaw community. | CTO Claude | PARKED |
| 5 | 2026-02-11 | Roundtable synthesis in daily digest — not just "what happened" but "what cross-signals emerged across all strategies today." Curator pattern. | CTO Claude | PARKED |
| 6 | 2026-02-11 | Multi-strategy shared context — when running memecoins + predictions + perps, each strategy writes to its own subdirectory. Strategist (Sonnet) reads across all for cross-signals. | CTO Claude | PARKED |
| 7 | 2026-02-11 | ChronoBets prediction market skill — place small USDC bets on Pyth oracle markets (BTC/ETH/SOL) as conviction calibration. Prepare/submit pattern fits Blind KeyMan. | G + CTO Claude | PARKED — after core trading loop validated |
| 8 | 2026-02-10 | Structured reasoning chains at decision time, not just post-trade autopsy. Strategist (Sonnet) outputs logic tree with every trade decision, persisted in bead for fast human review. Pattern: evidence bundle → reasoning chain → decision → G audits the logic, not the trade. | G | PARKED |

## Selection Criteria

Ideas move from PARKED → ACTIVE when:
1. Core trading loop has 30+ days of production data
2. Edge Bank has meaningful pattern density (50+ beads)
3. G explicitly prioritizes the enhancement
4. The idea solves a demonstrated pain point (not speculative optimization)
